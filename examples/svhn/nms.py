    Non-maximum suppression: Greedily select high-scoring detections and
    skip detections that are significantly covered by a previously
    selected detection.

    This version is translated from Matlab code by Tomasz Malisiewicz,
    who sped up Pedro Felzenszwalb's code.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dets: ndarray
    each row is ['xmin', 'ymin', 'xmax', 'ymax', 'score']
    overlap: float
    minimum overlap ratio (0.3 default)

    output
    ------
    dets: ndarray
    remaining after suppression.
